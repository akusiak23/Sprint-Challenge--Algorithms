## Exercise I

a) O(n) - Variable grows at a constant, linear pace while the n remains constant.

b) O(n^4) - Each loops adds a cycle of n, hence to the 4th power.

c) O(n) - A basic linear function that depends on the input "bunnies". It runs until it reaches 0.

## Exercise II

To limit the amount of broken eggs, we use a binary search approach. Determine the amount of floors and find the midpoint. Then we go below or above the midpoint (n = n // 2) depending on whether the egg broke or not. We continue these steps until the the floor is found.
